# Overview
This project implements a Lasso Regression model to predict student final grades based on various input features. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a linear model that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the model's predictive accuracy and prevent overfitting.

# Features
Feature Selection: Lasso helps identify the most important features that affect the final grade.
Regularization: It applies L1 regularization to reduce the impact of less important features and improve the model's generalization.
# Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for visualizations)
